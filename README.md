# ecommerce_eda_μServices_api

This is an e-commerce microservices project developed using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, designed with a modern event-driven (EDA) and RESTful API architecture. It leverages distributed system design patterns to ensure high scalability, maintainability, and resilience. The system also incorporates a comprehensive observability stack — including centralized logging, metrics monitoring, and distributed tracing — to provide full visibility into system health and request flows across services.
